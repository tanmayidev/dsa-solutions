# Suduko Solver

You are given an N\*N sudoku grid (N is a multiple of 3). Solve the sudoku and print the solution.
To learn more about sudoku, go to this link Sudoku-Wikipedia.

### Input Format

First line contains a single integer N. Next N lines contains N integers each, where jth integer int ith line denotes the value at ith row and jth column in sudoku grid. This value is 0, if the cell is empty.

### Constraints

```
N=9 Solution exists for input matrix.
```

### Output Format

Print N lines containing N integers each, where jth integer int ith line denotes the value at ith row and jth column in sudoku grid, such that all cells are filled.

### Sample Input

```

```

### Explanation

We can solve Sudoku by one by one assigning numbers to empty cells. Before assigning a number, we check whether it is safe to assign. We basically check that the same number is not present in the current row, current column and current 3X3 subgrid. After checking for safety, we assign the number, and recursively check whether this assignment leads to a solution or not. If the assignment doesnâ€™t lead to a solution, then we try next number for the current empty cell. And if none of the number (1 to 9) leads to a solution, we return false.

- Find row, col of an unassigned cell
- If there is none, return true
- For digits from 1 to 9
  - If there is no conflict for digit at row, col assign digit to row, col and recursively try fill in rest of grid
  - If recursion successful, return true
  - Else, remove digit and try another
- If all digits have been tried and nothing worked, return false
